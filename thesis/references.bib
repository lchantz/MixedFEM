title = "Morphological evolution during phase separation and coarsening with strong inhomogeneous elasticity",
abstract = "We studied the morphological evolution during spinodal phase separation and subsequent coarsening in systems with a strong dependence of elastic constants on the composition. An efficient numerical method is developed for solving the two-dimensional inhomogeneous elastic equilibrium equations by using the conjugate gradient method. A simple model binary system with a symmetric miscibility gap is considered. It is shown that the early stages of spinodal phase separation in a solid solution with a 50-50% composition always result in an interconnected morphology, regardless of the degree of elastic inhomogeneity. For systems with strong elastic inhomogeneity, particle splitting and coalescence take place concurrently during coarsening. In the late stages, the morphology has the characteristics that the hard phase forms precipitates surrounded by the soft phase which forms the matrix, similar to that predicted previously by others using first-order approximations. An analysis of the coarsening kinetics shows that although the growth exponent decreases with the increase in the degree of elastic inhomogeneity, there is no freezing of the coarsening kinetics for all the cases that we studied, in contrast to that predicted previously by others. The effect of an externally applied strain on the two-phase morphology in the elastic regime is also discussed.",

abstract = {The main aim of this research work is to find the numerical solution based on a meshless technique for both the time-dependent Cahn–Hilliard and tumor growth partial differential equations. The temporal variable is discretized using a second-order method based on semi-implicit backward differential formula, and the stabilized term is added to the considered time discretization. Also, an adaptive time algorithm is used to reduce the number of iterations of the proposed time discretization. Besides, to approximate the spatial variables, the element-free Galerkin method is considered for both mathematical models. The result of full discrete schemes in studied models is solved via Biconjugate gradient stabilized algorithm. Some numerical simulations are reported to show the capability of the numerical scheme presented here.}

abstract = {We review physical, mathematical, and numerical derivations of the binary Cahn–Hilliard equation (after John W. Cahn and John E. Hilliard). The phase separation is described by the equation whereby a binary mixture spontaneously separates into two domains rich in individual components. First, we describe the physical derivation from the basic thermodynamics. The free energy of the volume Ω of an isotropic system is given by NV∫Ω[F(c)+0.5∊2|∇c|2]dx, where NV, c, F(c), ∊, and ∇c represent the number of molecules per unit volume, composition, free energy per molecule of a homogenous system, gradient energy coefficient related to the interfacial energy, and composition gradient, respectively. We define the chemical potential as the variational derivative of the total energy, and its flux as the minus gradient of the potential. Using the usual continuity equation, we obtain the Cahn–Hilliard equation. Second, we outline the mathematical derivation of the Cahn–Hilliard equation. The approach originates from the free energy functional and its justification of the functional in the Hilbert space. After calculating the gradient, we obtain the Cahn–Hilliard equation as a gradient flow. Third, various aspects are introduced using numerical methods such as the finite difference, finite element, and spectral methods. We also provide a short MATLAB program code for the Cahn–Hilliard equation using a pseudospectral method.}

abstract = {In this work, we propose a fast and efficient adaptive time step procedure for the Cahn–Hilliard equation. The temporal evolution of the Cahn–Hilliard equation has multiple time scales. For spinodal decomposition simulation, an initial random perturbation evolves on a fast time scale, and later coarsening evolves on a very slow time scale. Therefore, if a small time step is used to capture the fast dynamics, the computation is quite costly. On the other hand, if a large time step is used, fast time evolutions may be missed. Hence, it is essential to use an adaptive time step method to simulate phenomena with multiple time scales. The proposed time adaptivity algorithm is based on the discrete maximum norm of the difference between two consecutive time step numerical solutions. Numerical experiments in one, two, and three dimensions are presented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the adaptive time-stepping algorithm.}
